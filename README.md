# Wardrobe Wizard 👔✨

**Team Name:** Style and Syntax  
**Proposed Level of Achievement:** Project Apollo 🚀

## 📌 Overview

**Wardrobe Wizard** is a web application designed to help university students transition from uniforms to daily fashion with confidence. By digitising their wardrobe, tracking outfit history, and recommending combinations based on preferences and schedule, this app simplifies daily outfit planning.

## 🎯 Motivation

University life brings freedom but also the challenge of deciding what to wear daily. Without a uniform, students may find themselves repeating outfits or feeling overwhelmed. As Computing students ourselves, we wanted to counter the stereotype of looking unkempt by crafting a fun and functional fashion tool.
